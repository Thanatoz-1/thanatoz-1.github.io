      <description>Jupyter MAGIC cheatsheet
Jupyter notebooks are greatly used in the Python and Data Science community and by all the people who love Jupyter Notebooks. I love notebooks so much that even this post has been created using one jupyter notebook.
You might have come across commands such as %matplotlib inline %time %autoreload etc. These are called Jupyter MAGIC. Jupyter magic are special commands that are built-in jupyter notebooks to extend its capablities.</description>
